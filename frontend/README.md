# TTADP Frontend

## Getting Started

The `package.json` a directory up has commands to run/test/lint the frontend. However it may be useful to only run commands on the frontend, so those are documented here.

|-|-|
| `yarn start` | Start the frontend development server |
| `yarn build` | Build a production bundle |
| `yarn test` | Start the test watcher |
| `yarn test:ci src` | Run unit tests a single time |
